# Password Cracker Project

## How to Run?
- Import *not_so_smart_users.sql* into your database
- In *config.php* edit DB connection settings
- In *crack-passwords.php* edit *set_time_limit(500)* as you wish. 500 is not enough for completing the task 4.
- In the web browser open *index.php*

## Notes
- In case you need to find different type of passwords ( for example: Uppercase 5 characters ), open *index.php* and edit tasks Javascript object.
- If you run the script on Cloudflare, you will get 524 Error. To prevent this, run the script on a subdomain with no Cloudflare proxy.
